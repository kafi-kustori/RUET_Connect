## 🎯 Project Vision

Imagine never missing another campus event, workshop, or important notice again. **RUET Connect** transforms how students experience university life by creating a centralized digital hub for all campus activities.

### The Problem We Solved
Students at RUET were constantly missing out on opportunities because:
- Important notices were scattered across multiple platforms
- Event information was poorly communicated
- No single place to discover workshops and club activities
- Manual, outdated communication methods created gaps

### Our Solution
A beautiful, intuitive Flutter mobile app that brings everything together in one place - making campus life more connected and engaging.
